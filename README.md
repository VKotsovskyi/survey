### Notes for evaluator
* I didn't implement Country and Family Number Select input, because of time and it's not hard at all so I hope it's not a problem. Please let me know if it must be feature.
* I didn't write webpack config, because want to spend less time on start - found it in internet, but I wrote one before.
* Valid phone format `123-123-1234`
* Zip - `12345` or `12345-1234`
